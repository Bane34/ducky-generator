You need to download the keyboard library. You can do this in the arduino IDE.
In the tools bar just go to Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries
Then, just search for the library and install it.

After all of this, download the code, open it in the arduino IDE, after this, go to Tools > Board and search for your arduino. Congratulations, just upload the code and you will have and arduino rubber ducky.
